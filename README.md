# ðŸ¦” Sonic the Hedgehog: Speedrunnersâ€™ Edition

## Development

Start by getting a Windows shell running, either a PowerShell or CMD instance, opened on the repositoryâ€™s root directory.

### Compile

To compile the code, issue the command `.\build.bat`. This will build the codebase using the ASM68K compiler for Motorola 68000 assembler, using `main.asm` as the entry point, apply the `fixheadr` tool to the resulting binary, and save the binary as `output.bin`, which can be run in any Mega Drive emulator. If `output.bin` already exists from a previous build, the old build will be renamed to `output.bin.old` to make room for the new build output. If there are any build errors, `output.bin` will not be generated and the errors will be listed in `errors.txt`.

### Run

To execute and test the resultant binary, issue the command `.\run.bat`. This will open the output â€“ if it exists â€“ in Kega Fusion, which is the default emulator for testing purposes (as itâ€™s the most accurate). If you wish to configure the emulatorâ€™s settings at run time, please feel free, as the configuration `.ini` file is set to be ignored by Git so that it doesnâ€™t get included in commits. `output.bin` can also be run manually in any other emulator if you so choose; Gens is also include in the emulators subdirectory for convinience.
